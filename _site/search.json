The second graph shows the urban population within world regions from 2010 to 2021. The third graph does the same but with rural populations. The last graph shows us the urbal and rural growth rates of each world region.\n#The Graphs East Asia & Pacific, North America, and Europe & Central Asia spend the most on education.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe East Asia & Pacific region has the largest urban population while Central Europe & the Baltics, and Southern and Eastern African countries have the lowest urban populations. Urban poulations for all regions are growing.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe East Asia & Pacific and South Asian regions have the largest rural populations."

    "section": "",
    "text": "How does the effects of national government expenditure on education differ from the urban population to the rural population? The data to answer the question was sourced from the World Bank Universal Indicator dataset, and then the relevant data frames were combined to analyze the relationship between government expenditure on urban populations vs. rural populations. Increased expenditure on education typically increases the urban population, decreases the rural population, but still benefits both in terms of quality of life and access to resources."
