The second graph shows the amount of money different world regions spend on education. The third graph shows the urban population within world regions from 2010 to 2020. The last graph does the same but with rural populations."

The data to answer the question was sourced from the World Bank Universal Indicator dataset, and then the relevant data frames were combined to analyze the relationships between government expenditure on urban populations vs. rural populations. The graphs below show that there is very little connection between urban and rural population growths and how much a country’s government spends on its education department. The linear regression models in the models tab depict that as well."

    "text": "As we saw in the Home and model pages, increased expenditure on education does not have a substantial impact upon urban and rural population growths. Despite this, increased spending on education still benefits both rural and urban populations in terms of quality of life and access to resources. However, it is important to keep in mind that these relationships are mainly correlative as there are many other factors that we must consider before we determine these associations to be causal."
